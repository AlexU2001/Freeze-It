 A game for the lighting game jam with the theme of freezing

 ## Patch Notes for Post Jam Update
 ### Major Changes
 * New Mechanic, gates can now be blocked by frozen objects.
 * New ice cube types, deep and light, with freeze duration of 3 and 10 respectively.
 * Regular ice cube now freezes for 7 seconds (was 5 seconds).
 * New Freeze Blaster that shoots freezing particles.

* Ice cube in level 1 has been changed into a light variant.
* Level 3 cube display now has a block for the cubes to stand on before being pushed off.
* Level 4 intended solution has changed.
* New level 5 featuring the freeze blaster.
### Sound Updates
* New game music.
* Ice cubes play a sound when colliding with anything.
* Freezing objects plays a brief sound effect.
* The goal now plays a sound effect when you are near it.

### Planned Changes
There is no established timeline for when these changes will roll out.
* Way to distinguish between colored blocks for color blind players.
* 5 new levels.
* Animated acid pits.
* Controller support.
* Better looking levels.
   * Adding some decorations and possibly forms of enviromental story telling is as far as I intend to go with this

### Wanted Changes
These are changes that I tried to and or wanted to implement but gave up
* Grabbed objects cannot go through walls and would adjust to maintain themselves within the level space
  * I haven't yet explored this. Until then placing objects through walls is a feature and is part of the puzzles.
* Slopes, the player can't go up slopes.
  * My attempts were scrapped as I needed to manage my time to complete my jam submission.
