# Freeze It
 A game for the lighting game jam with the theme of freezing

 ## Patch Notes for Post Jam Update (Not Yet Released)
 ### Major Changes
 * New Mechanic, gates can now be blocked by frozen objects.
 * New ice cube types, deep and light, with freeze duration of 3 and 7 respectively.
 * Regular ice cube now freezes for 7 seconds (Was 5 seconds)
   * Deep ice shares this duration but trust me it is different ;).
 * New Freeze Blaster that shoots freezing particles.
 * Partial controller support
### Level Updates
* Ice cube in level 1 has been changed into a light variant.
* Level 3 cube display now has a block for the cubes to stand on before being pushed off.
* Level 4 intended solution has changed.
* New level 5 introducing the freeze blaster.
* New level 7
  * Still working on the levels before, 7 has lots of variables so it has to go later. Might bump it higher actually.  
### Sound Updates
* New game music.
* Ice cubes play a sound when colliding with anything.
* Freezing objects plays a brief sound effect.
* The goal now plays a sound effect when you are near it.

### Planned Changes
There is no established timeline for when these changes will roll out however they are listed out in order of priority.
1. New levels.
2. More Music
3. Way to distinguish between colored blocks for color blind players.
4. Visual upgrades for existing objects
5. Better looking levels
   * Adding some decorations and possibly forms of enviromental story telling is as far as I intend to go with this
6. Keyboard rebinding
7. Controller rebinding
8. Animated acid pits.
9. Full controller support.

### Experimented Changes
These are changes that I tried to and or wanted to implement but gave up
* Grabbed objects cannot go through walls and would adjust to maintain themselves within the level space
  * I haven't yet explored this. Until then placing objects through walls is a feature and is part of the puzzles. Though I'll use it sparingly.
* Slopes, the player can't go up slopes very well. Adding better slope support could help the level design feel less... blocky.
  * My initial attempts were scrapped as I needed to manage my time to complete my jam submission.
* Freeze blaster freezes held objects
  * This would require changing some of the planned levels but I think would expand my toolkit. Initial experiments have failed.
